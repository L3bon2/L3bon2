# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior software developer who enjoys working on backend APIs and contributing to open-source projects. I'm passionate about using tech to make things more inclusive and accessible.

ðŸš§ I'm currently building a full-stack fruit ordering app that helps local farmers connect with their communities. It's a work in progress, and I'm excited to keep learning and improving along the way.

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and ways to grow as a developer.
